One of the key lessons learned was that even the most complicated process of software development should be broken down into very simple and fundamental units of tasks.
In order for a development project to be successful, core functions should be tackled first and it should be connected as an integrated system. 
“The Pragmatic Programmer” explains this concept through two basic principles of ‘orthogonality’ and ‘tracer bullets’.
The former emphasizes the importance of keeping the non-related functions separate so that modification in one part does not affect the other.
By breaking down various functions into autonomous realms, it will eliminate the interdependence of among the modules.
This allows the programmer to change one part without having to adjust the others.
Secondly, in case of ‘tracer bullets’, it allows the project team to develop a skeleton around the core function and enable the programmer to see the ‘end-to-end’ flow of the software.
It allows the project team to build a basic framework that programmers can work on and a very high level concept of the entire software architecture.
This saves time and resources because it could be built in a relatively shorter period without extremely heavy investments.
Such approach flips the notion that the software development should be meticulous from the very beginning.
Further, one additional key aspect is that such development of simple steps and integration processes could be accelerated by various tools.
In the offline aspect, the project team could utilize ‘post-it’ to keep track and communicate with each other.
In the online world, the team could also use virtual task management platform such as JIRA, Lighthouse, Basecamp, etc. to track project status to boost productivity via increased clarity in communications.
