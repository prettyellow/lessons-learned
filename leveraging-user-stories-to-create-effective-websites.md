One of the first steps in developing an effective website is to brainstorm relevant user stories before any coding actually takes place.  This is to ensure development is lean, implementation estimates are accurate, and project stakeholder needs are sufficiently met.  User stories are short phrases or sentences in laymen terms that fundamentally describe what end users do or need and how the website will eventually be leveraged.  User stories help guide programmers throughout the development process so that fundamental requirements are adequately addressed.  A common user story form is the “connextra” format, where the user’s basic roles, functions, and benefits are highlighted.  When writing user stories, some key considerations must be kept in mind. First, it is of utmost importance that focus be placed on domain experts and their values versus what the programmer wants or needs.  Secondly, a good set of user stories should describe usage requirements in addition to more obvious technical requirements.  Last but not least, to ensure the development process is as streamlined as possible, project managers should prioritize user requirements and have devopers estimate job sizes for each user story so that backlog job queues are executed in the appropriate order.  User stories are essential in that they help developers define specific functions and requirements that are both critical and directly relevant.  This helps both project managers and programmers to design more efficiently (with minimal iterations), set better, more granular guidelines for work to be performed, and establish more effective contracts that ensure a fitting and appropriate end product is produced on time and within anticipated budgets.
