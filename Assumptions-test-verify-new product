From the Perfect Paper case assignment, Iâ€™ve learned basic assumptions that need to be addressed so that we can evaluate whether this project is realistic or not. 
Such assumptions as there is enough demand for the product, or there are problems with current system, would allow us to capture the business opportunities related to this issue. 
Also, setting up the test methods for those assumptions in advance would help us to figure out the overall workload and to schedule tests based on priority. 
If all or critical assumptions regarding new product are verified, then we can start to working on next step: user story.
