The first step in creating an effective website is to brainstorm relevant user stories before any coding takes place.  User stories are short phrases or sentences in laymen terms that fundamentally describe what end users do or need and how they intend upon leveraging the website being produced.  A common user story form is the “connextra” format where the user’s basic role, function, and benefit is highlighted.  When developing user stories, it is of utmost importance that the focus be placed on stakeholders and stakeholder values external to what the programmer wants or needs.  User stories should concern the end user and not the developer.  User stories are critical in that they help developers define specific functions and requirements for the website that are both necessary and directly relevant.  This helps both design managers and programmers design more efficiently (with minimal iterations), set better, more granular guidelines for work to be performed, and establish more effective contracts that ensure a fitting and appropriate end product is produced on time and within anticipated budgets.
